Currently, only a subset can do this. \r\n\r\nBackground\r\n======================================================================\r\nPradnya,\r\n \r\nLet\u2019s try and get some requirements around this and more detail around scenarios, and info about what the exact issue is. I think you mean is it\u2019s an issue in and out of the show office. And I think you mean you want to expand the set of users in the portal or that plus creating a different role for them?\r\n \r\nOne important question is for non-TI staff. Would SFA staff be OK w/ allowing non-show / non-main-contacts into the portal. A billing person could make directory changes. Are they OK w/ that? If not then it becomes an MYS question as to if they can allow fine grained permissions in their app and via SSO. If MYS can\u2019t do this, then maybe other staff needs to be OK w/ more open access in order for finance to get their payments. \r\n \r\nI think it seems like we first need to deal w/ these above questions (is it feasible on the MYS side and will staff say \u201cno we don\u2019t want this\u201d or can we override them). I think the first place to start is on the MYS to see if it\u2019s feasible to have more fine grain control. \r\n \r\nOr did you mean - is there a way to have a workaround outside of MYS to get payment in the show office? Like using authorize.net directly to send them a onetime invoice? Or just use Square or something? \r\n \r\nJohnny\r\n \r\nFrom: Pradnya Devare \r\nSent: Tuesday, January 23, 2018 11:27 AM\r\nTo: Johnny Saucedo <jsaucedo@specialtyfood.com>\r\nCc: Karen Tracey <kmtracey@caktusgroup.com>\r\nSubject: People making payments in MYS\r\n \r\nHi Johnny,\r\n \r\nWe are seeing that people other than the main contact and show contact walk into the sales office and wanting to make a payment for the W19 show... they are billing or just general staff.  \r\nIs there any way for these people to pay?
